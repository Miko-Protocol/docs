# 2.2 MIKO Token: The World's First AI-Curated Dynamic Reward Asset

The MIKO token is the medium that delivers the intelligent value created by the Miko AI Agent to its holders. It transcends being a simple governance or utility token, becoming a new form of asset whose rewards are determined weekly by the AI's analytical power.

## 2.2.1 Token Mechanism: 5% Transfer Tax

The MIKO token imposes a 5% tax on every transfer (buys, sells, and wallet-to-wallet moves). This tax serves as the core engine for funding the protocol's rewards.

## 2.2.2 The Reward Flywheel: Automated Buy-and-Distribute

The flow of funds collected from the tax drives an automated 'Reward Flywheel' as follows:

1.  **Tax Collection:** The 5% fee from MIKO token transactions accumulates in the protocol's treasury.
2.  **Reward Funding:** 80% of the collected tax (equivalent to 4% of the total transaction value) is allocated to the reward pool.
3.  **Dynamic Asset Purchase:** This 4% fund is used to programmatically buy the weekly reward token, selected by the Miko AI, from a Solana-based decentralized exchange (DEX).
4.  **Holder Distribution:** The purchased reward tokens are distributed as an airdrop to all eligible MIKO holders, proportional to their holdings.
