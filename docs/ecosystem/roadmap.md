# Project Roadmap

The MIKO Protocol will continuously grow and evolve through a clear, phased development plan. Each phase builds on the success of the previous one, with the AI model being continuously enhanced throughout all stages. The ultimate goal is to build a fully decentralized, intelligent financial ecosystem.

## Phase 1: Genesis and Protocol Launch (Current)

-   **Launch Miko AI Agent v1.0:** Activate the initial version of the AI agent with features for collecting KOL tweets, building a knowledge base, and selecting weekly reward tokens.
-   **Deploy MIKO Token Smart Contract:** Deploy the MIKO token and reward distribution contracts using the `Token-2022` standard on the Solana mainnet.
-   **Initial Liquidity Provision and Trading Start:** Provide initial liquidity on major Solana DEXs and commence trading of the $MIKO token.
-   **Commence Weekly Reward Cycle:** Start the regular weekly dynamic reward distribution cycle, beginning with the selection of the first weekly reward token.

## Phase 2: Ecosystem Tools and Insight Enhancement

-   **Launch 'MIKO's Insight' Dashboard:** Release an analytics dashboard that transparently provides the community with data collected and analyzed by the AI.
-   **Reward Hall of Fame:** Transparently track and record the performance of all tokens selected as weekly rewards to demonstrate the AI's analytical capabilities.
-   **KOL Spotlight:** Based on the analysis of over 400 KOL tweets, highlight the individual who provided the most narrative inspiration for the week, offering new perspectives to the community.
-   **Formalize Ecosystem Partnership Program:** Establish official partnerships with projects selected as weekly reward tokens. Position MIKO as a hub of collaboration within the Solana ecosystem through joint AMAs, cross-promotions, and more.

## Phase 3: Community Web3 Integration and Participation Rewards

-   **Launch 'MIKO's Circle' Platform:** Build an innovative platform that connects users' social activities (X) with their on-chain activities (wallet).
-   **Introduce Participate-to-Earn Mechanism:** Through the platform, select outstanding community members who have interacted most actively with Miko or created the most inspiring posts during the week, and provide them with differentiated benefits such as $MIKO token airdrops. This will serve as the foundation for forming an 'ambassador' group that actively contributes to the ecosystem, beyond just being holders.
-   **Long-Term Vision - Multi-Platform Expansion:** Starting with X, the long-term goal is to gradually expand Miko's sphere of activity to new social platforms like Farcaster.

## Phase 4: The Ultimate Vision of the MIKO Ecosystem - The AI-Curation Launchpad

The long-term vision of the MIKO Protocol is to maximize the analytical power of its AI to add tangible value to the Solana ecosystem. The final stage of this vision is the introduction of an **'AI-Curation Launchpad'**.

Current launchpads on Solana offer the dynamism of allowing anyone to easily issue a token, but this also brings a flood of 'noise' and potential risks. MIKO aims to solve this problem by leveraging its core AI capabilities.

The Miko AI will serve as a filter, analyzing the countless new projects appearing on the launchpad in real-time to assess their potential and credibility. This will become MIKO's unique utility, helping investors separate the wheat from the chaff in a sea of information. Furthermore, the revenue generated from this launchpad will be used to increase the value of the $MIKO token, creating another powerful flywheel that drives the ecosystem's sustainable growth. This will be the final step in MIKO's evolution from a simple reward token to a core infrastructure contributing to the healthy growth of the Solana ecosystem.
